    "# B+ Tree Implementation Report\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation of a B+ Tree supports key operations such as **insertion**, **deletion**, **search**, **update**, **range queries**, and **tree visualization**. It handles **internal and leaf nodes**, keeps the tree balanced, and provides efficient lookup and data management, especially for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "### `BPlusTreeNode`\n",
    "Represents a node in the B+ Tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__init__(self, order, parent=None, is_leaf=False)`: Initializes a node.\n",
    "  - `order`: The maximum number of children a node can have.\n",
    "  - `parent`: Reference to the parent node.\n",
    "  - `is_leaf`: Boolean indicating if this is a leaf node.\n",
    "  - `keys`: Stores the keys.\n",
    "  - `values`: Stores either child nodes or values.\n",
    "  - `next`: Links to the next leaf node (used for range queries).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Helper Methods:\n",
    "- `is_full()`: Returns `True` if the node is full.\n",
    "- `has_excess_keys(min_keys)`: Checks if node has more than `min_keys`.\n",
    "- `is_underflow(min_keys)`: Checks if the node has fewer than `min_keys` (except root).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### `BPlusTree`\n",
    "Encapsulates the full B+ Tree structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Constructor:\n",
    "- `__init__(order=4)`: Initializes the tree with the given order (minimum 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### `_find_leaf(key)`\n",
    "Traverses from the root to the appropriate **leaf node** for the given `key`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `search(key)`\n",
    "Finds and returns the value for a given `key`. Returns `None` if not found.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `insert(key, value)`\n",
    "Inserts a key-value pair into the B+ Tree. If the target leaf becomes full, splits the node and recursively updates parents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `delete(key)`\n",
    "Removes a key and its value from the tree. Handles **underflow** by borrowing from siblings or merging nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `update(key, new_value)`\n",
    "Updates the value for the specified key.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Range and Traversal\n",
    "\n",
    "### `range_query(start_key, end_key)`\n",
    "Returns all key-value pairs in the range `[start_key, end_key]` using the leaf node linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `get_all()`\n",
    "Returns all key-value pairs in the tree in sorted order.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Internal Utilities\n",
    "\n",
    "### `_split_node(node)`\n",
    "Splits a full node into two. Adjusts parent nodes accordingly and updates leaf links if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `_insert_in_parent(left, key, right)`\n",
    "Inserts a new key and right child into the parent of `left`. Creates a new root if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `_handle_underflow(node)`\n",
    "Handles underflow situations during deletion:\n",
    "- Tries to borrow from left/right siblings.\n",
    "- Merges nodes if borrowing isn't possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `_borrow_from_left(...) / _borrow_from_right(...)`\n",
    "Shifts keys/values from sibling to fix underflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `_merge_nodes(left, right, parent, index)`\n",
    "Merges two sibling nodes and adjusts the parent node accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "### `visualize_tree()`\n",
    "Creates a **Graphviz** diagram of the B+ Tree:\n",
    "- Uses boxes for nodes.\n",
    "- Highlights leaves with a different color.\n",
    "- Connects leaf nodes with dashed arrows.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensures all internal nodes maintain `len(values) = len(keys) + 1`.\n",
    "- Leaf nodes are linked via `next` pointers for fast range queries.\n",
    "- Error checking and assertions help validate tree invariants during operations.\n",

    "`Overview`  \n",
    "This report presents a demonstration of the B+ Tree class functionality, specifically focusing on its insert and delete operations, including how it handles edge cases. Additionally, we have verified the accuracy of our B+ Tree implementation and showcased the persistence of two database tables.\n",

    "`Key Insights from Performance Evaluation` \n",
    "\n",
    "`Insertion` \n",
    "Building a B+ Tree index introduces both time and memory costs, especially during sorted insertions which can lead to higher memory consumption. For raw insertion speed and minimal memory use, the Brute Force approach outperforms the B+ Tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Update`\n",
    "Due to its fast search capabilities, updating records via the B+ Tree is considerably quicker than using the Brute Force method.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Search` \n",
    "For exact-match queries, the B+ Tree significantly outpaces linear scanning, offering logarithmic time complexity versus the linear performance of Brute Force.\n",

    "`Deletion`  \n",
    "The structured nature of the B+ Tree enables much faster and more efficient deletions, especially when dealing with large-scale data.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Range Query`\n",
    "Thanks to its linked leaf nodes, the B+ Tree is particularly efficient for executing range queries, while Brute Force relies on scanning the entire dataset.\n",
